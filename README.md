# PlantJam2 took part in the Thailand Horror Jam, but it wasn't completed on time.

This is my first game jam, and I did all of this in 2-3 day-ish? I did not submit my game on time because I overscoped it.

I'm reminding myself that I've only been using Unity for a few weeks. You and I both have room to grow.

31/10/2023 Edit I had planned to release my game today, but I was unable to do so. I therefore alter my plan to update over time.
